This script sends the notes of your zone to a CSV file. Inputting a zone is required.
You can set a limit of notes to display and epoch time if preferred.
The credentials are read in from a configuration file in the same directory.
The file is named config.ini in the format:

API Login Information

-h            Show the help message and exit
-z            Search for zone report with zone name
-l            The maximum number of notes to retrieve
-e            Use epoch time instead of a formatted time
-f            Set file name. Default: notes_[zonename].csv
